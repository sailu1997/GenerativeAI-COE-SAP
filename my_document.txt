PROJECTS
See True Social
DSTA-Singapore
z July’23
Project aims at finding true vs fake given a social profile which has image , title , comments and posts. Used BERT,RoBERTa , GPT various models for detecting fake profile for the NLP Task.While BERT performed well among all the models. Used Resnet50 for the CV (image fake/true detection).while CV task able to acheive 99.6 % accuracy , NLP Task we are only able to acheive 78.6% accuracy, and the over all accuracy of the social profiles is at 68.7% accuracy.Using Ensemble average able to acheive 88.7% accuracy.
HDB Rental rate prediction in Singapore
NUS-Coursework
