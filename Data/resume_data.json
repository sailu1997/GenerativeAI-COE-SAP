     "Projects":"See True Social \nDSTA-Singapore July\u201923 \nProject aims at finding true vs fake given a social profile which has image , title , comments and posts. Used BERT,RoBERTa , GPT various models for detecting fake profile for the NLP Task.While BERT performed well among all the models. Used Resnet50 for the CV (image fake/true detection).while CV task able to acheive 99.6 % accuracy , NLP Task we are only able to acheive 78.6% accuracy, and the over all accuracy of the social profiles is at 68.7% accuracy.Using Ensemble average able to acheive 88.7% accuracy. \nHDB Rental rate prediction in Singapore \nNUS-Coursework Sept\u201923 \nProject aims at predicting rental rate in Singapore.The task is a regression task. Worked on DataCleaning, Dat- aPreprocessing, DataTransformation. Basic Linear regressor did not perform well on the given dataset. Ran- dom forests/XGBoost performed well.Perfomed cross validation and hyperparameter tuning using Hyper- opt.Acheived a RMSE score of 481.20848. \n",
